# Weekly Reflection 

# Week 1 

Tasks Completed:
- Chose a project

This week I spent time brainstorming an idea for a project. I had an idea that I previously planned to do, but after thinking it through realized it might not be ideal for this project. My original idea was for an American Mahjong hand analyzer that would help players during the game by analyzing their tiles and telling them the best hand. However, I realized a few things. 

First, American Mahjong is not very popular, and most people don't know how to play it. It might be difficult for classmates and potential employers to relate to this program for a complicated game they don't know how to play. Next, in order to play, you need a special card with the year's hands printed on it. It's illegal to copy or distribute these cards online. By creating an application that tells players hand ideas, I would be going against the creater's wishes by publishing their hands and allowing people to play who don't own a card. 

So with these things in mind, I went to work brainstorming a new project idea. I ended up deciding on an application related to Stardew Valley, a popular video game. I love this idea because it's a great accessible game that a lot of people play, and a resource like the Stardew Valley Assistant will be helpful to people needing quick information. Also, for my final PHP project last year I did a project related to Stardew Valley as well, and I love that my portfolio will be themed and show different ways I'm solving problems in a specific game. 

### Week 2

Tasks completed:
- Set up repository in Github

This week has been crazy - I'm currently working two jobs for the next few weeks (last few weeks of one, first few weeks of another) and have had minimal time for school work unfortunately. However, I did manage to get my project repository set up and linked to the Student repository in Github. 

### Week 3

Tasks completed:
- Finished problem statement 

Still working two jobs, but trying so hard to get caught up. This week I finished adding my problem statement to my README and spent time getting caught up on my classwork. 

### Week 4

Tasks completed:
- Created project plan and planning documents 
- Created wireframes in Figma
- Created user stories
- Updated reflections 

So happy to finally have time to devote to my project. So far this week I sketched out my screens on scratch paper and then built them out as wireframes in Figma. I also spent time setting up the rest of the design and tracking files I need in my project structure, as well as starting to think big picture about what I need to do and learn for the rest of my project.
